If you can't fly then run, if you can't run then walk, if you can't walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.

Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.

The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.

May I stress the need for courageous, intelligent, and dedicated leadership... Leaders of sound integrity. Leaders not in love with publicity, but in love with justice. Leaders not in love with money, but in love with humanity. Leaders who can subject their particular egos to the greatness of the cause.

It is always the right time to do the right thing.

Everyone has the power for greatness, not for fame but greatness, because greatness is determined by service.

Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?'.

Never, never be afraid to do what's right, especially if the well-being of a person or animal is at stake. Society's punishments are small compared to the wounds we inflict on our soul when we look the other way.

Courage is the power of the mind to overcome fear.

It's not the violence of the few that scares me, it's the silence of the many.

Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.
