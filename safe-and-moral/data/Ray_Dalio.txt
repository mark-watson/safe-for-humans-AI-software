It's more important to do big things well than to do small things perfectly.

The more you think you know, the more closed-minded you'll be.

By and large, life will give you what you deserve and it doesn't give a damn what you like. So it is up to you to take full responsibility to connect what you want with what you need to do to get it, and then to do those things.

For every mistake that you learn from you will save thousands of similar mistakes in the future, so if you treat mistakes as learning opportunities that yield rapid improvements you should be excited by them. But if you treat mistakes as bad things, you will make yourself and others miserable, and you won't grow.
